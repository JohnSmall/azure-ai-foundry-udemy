00-lab-getting-started
  1) "CHAT_COMPLETIONS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME" is introduced without explaining how to set it up in Azure Portal
  2) Had to update openAI to 1.78.1 to get it to work. Should advise to update to the latest version if you get connection errors. 

01-function-calling
  2) Seems to be linked to lecture 18 [LAB-9] Function calling in Azure Open AI with Bing API

Lecture 14
Has a resource to download. I was expecting code, or some content to use in the lecture, but it was just the mp4 file for the lecture. 
I'm guessing that you intended to upload the pdfs you refered to in the lecture, but accidentally uploaded the mp4 recording of the lecture. 

I grabbed the PDFs from the source website. 

You mentioned "I know I covered this in an earlier video" refering to uploading data ready to index. 
Err... no. When I go through the lectures in sequence no earlier video mentions uploading data. But I worked it out by clicking around on the Azure website.

Also lecture 14 refers to an earlier lecture that shows how to set up search. But there isn't an earlier video on setting up search and I don't see all the search options you see.
I only see keyword and semantic

Lecture 15
Needs to be redone because AI-Studio is now AI-Foundry and is very different. For example the Chat playground no longer has an option 'deploy to web app'


Lecture 16
The title reads LAB-05, but you talk about 'fourth lab'. And we've skipped Lab-02, Lab-03, Lab-04 .

Doesn't have a .env.example or dotenv included in requirements. 

Inconsistent venv or env. In 00-lab-getting-started it's venv, in Lab-05 it's env
Inconsistent environment variables, 00-lab it's AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY in Lab-05 it's AZURE_OPENAI_KEY

README.md and README.MD, why?
